            <h5>Code of Conduct</h5>
                    <p>
                    We, the organizers of **Nodeschool Raipur**, are dedicated to providing a
                    harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or
                    expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body
                    size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of
                    community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be
                    sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizers
                    of **Nodeschool Raipur**.

                    Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender
                    identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                    age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate
                    intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
                    sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
                    and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
                    for any events at **Nodeschool Raipur** meetups or in any related
                    communication channels. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior
                    are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to
                    the anti-harassment policy.

                    If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of
                    **Nodeschool Raipur** may take any action they deem appropriate, including
                    warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being
                    harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns,
                    please contact an organizer immediately.

                    The organizers of the above communities developed this Code of Conduct to
                    govern their respective events and communication channels. We used [PDX
                    Python's anti-harassment policy](http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/pages/Code_of_Conduct/)
                    and the [Geek Feminism Conference anti-harassment policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
                    as a starting point. This Code of Conduct, like its inspirations, is licensed under
